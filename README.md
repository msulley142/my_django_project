Build a new Django Application with two API endpoints. The first endpoint allows an end user to create a new Dog model by making a POST to /api/dogs, view current dogs that have been saved to the server before by making a GET to /api/dogs, and get, modify, or delete an existing Dog record by making a GET, PUT, or DELETE request (respectively) to /api/dogs/<id> where <id> is the id of the Dog record to be retrieved, modified, or deleted. Since a Dog includes a foreign key to the breed, you also need to make the same type of endpoints for dog breed at /api/breeds/ and /api/breeds/<id>.
