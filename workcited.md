Tools: Github's Copilot Assistant, ChatGPT
 
Github's Copilot Assistance 
1. I used Github's Copilot Assitance for a large portion of this assigment. When I typed out functions, the AI assistant would finish them  or correct it if I made a mistake. 95% of time it would give me a suggestion of something I already planned to type out.

Chatgpt 
2. I used to ChatGPT to help find mistakes that caused error messages.
I also used to ChatGPT to figure what issues I had that would not allow my web application to run on local host.
